# Thesis-project: Warmth and Competence debiasing of profession related text

The project explores how **SCM framework** (Stereotype Content Model) applied in **Masked Language Modelling (MLM)** can facilitate bias detection and mitigation in profession-related text. Moreover, it touches upon the warmth and competence bias present in **BERT pre-trained transformer model**, explores to what extent bias can be limited with **projection** approach and considers semantic meaning retention of embeddings after debiasing. The study analyses complex and context dependent concepts affecting every industy utilizing AI-based decision-making especially recruitment during shortlisting and screening of candidates.

## Repository Structure 
- data = folder containing all data needed to run the code thus csv files and xlsx files used in the analysis
- models = this folder contains code run on my own machine showing the results on which the analysis was based upon and shows the results were a code-generated. Each model's run is aroung 2 hours.
-  main folder files = these files are modified 'models' files allowing for code reproducibility as those contain relative paths (not as the models' files which were run on a private machine) and profession mapping file which shows EDA performed on O'NET data source.
